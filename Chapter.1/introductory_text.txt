Teaser question: width of a Boolean data type
1. 8 bytes (why not bits) for header + 1 byte (why not bit?) for true/false = 9 bytes. So approximated to 16 bytes by Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
2. why JVM? why won't the CPU in the current machine store it?

Q&A portion
1. source code (why not just code?)
2. Udemy's Q&A has a nice program editor.
3. Once you paste your java program there seeking clarification, it will appear nicely formatted and colour coded.
4. Supplement your code with image attachment.
5. Search Q&A before asking your question. Search within a certain lecture to narrow your search.
6. Ask a specific question and ask it as a new question.

Source code:
1. Typing in the code in the editor.
2. Running the code
3. Solve the errors
